name: football-odds-model
description: >-
  Bookmaker-style match analysis for football/soccer. Use when the user asks to
  estimate the probability of a match result, correct-score odds, who will win,
  over/under, draw chances, value vs the market, or to model a World Cup /
  tournament (champion, advancement). Converts Elo + market odds into true
  probabilities via Poisson + Dixon-Coles, de-margins bookmaker odds
  (proportional/power/Shin), and runs Monte Carlo for outright/tournament
  questions. Also use when the user wants to build or update the market-context
  CSV/JSON pipeline, including Odds API ingestion, recorded fixture JSON, import,
  validation, or end-to-end automation. Handles home advantage, altitude,
  weather, injuries, motivation and fatigue. Educational/analytical only —

# Football Odds Model — v3.9 bundle (KO n=24 review: λ-floor 0.30 + ensemble w=0.6 ADOPTED; graded-k held)

中文：这是一个从博彩公司定价视角出发的足球比赛分析 skill。它用于估算胜平负、
正确比分、大小球、BTTS、让球、锦标赛晋级/冠军概率，以及对比模型概率和市场
盘口。只做数学和模型解释，不给投注建议。

> v3.6 engine defaults (NOW IN CODE): gd_per_100 **0.65**, avg_goals **2.90**,
> draw_boost **0.06**, opp-style `auto` (fatten favourite tail when |λ_h−λ_a|≥1.65),
> Tipset draw gate 0.42. Validated on **54** played 2026 games (48 in-sample + 6
> Jun-24 OUT-OF-SAMPLE): W/D/L **63%** (34/54), RPS **0.1508**, scoreline logL
> −155.58, model draw% **25.7** vs actual 25.9, blowout 15 actual vs **13.2**
> expected, O/U2.5 Brier **0.2522**. Beats v3.5 on every metric INCLUDING
> out-of-sample (OOS-6 RPS 0.1834→0.1758).
> WHY v3.6 over v3.4/v3.5: as the 48-team field reached match-day 3, favourites
> separated even more (gd slope 0.55→0.60→0.65) and decisive games pushed the
> real draw rate DOWN to 25.9% (draw_boost 0.07→0.06 re-aligns it), while O/U
> calibration wanted avg_goals 2.85→2.90.
> CONCLUSION: engine near the practical ceiling on 1X2 direction (~61–63%).
> Remaining error is irreducible (favourite-held draws, exact blowout size) OR
> comes from MISSING MATCH-DAY INFO, not the params: confirmed line-ups,
> already-qualified rotation, and de-margined closing odds are the real next
> gains — not more tuning. Recent misses (South Africa 1-0 Korea, Canada 1-3
> Switzerland) were both motivation/rotation upsets the params cannot see.

> STAGE PROFILES (group vs knockout). The group "model" and the knockout "model"
> are the SAME engine with different parameter values, picked by `--stage`:
> - `--stage group` (default) = frozen v3.7A above (gd 0.65 / db 0.06 / ag 2.90).
>   Regression-locked; do not change.
> - `--stage knockout` = lower goals (`avg_goals` 2.70 — knockouts grind), plus an
>   **advancement resolver**. A knockout has no draw: a level game after 90' goes
>   to ET then penalties, so the draw mass is split by a near-coin-flip shootout
>   (`pen_tilt` 0.20 Elo tilt), and the 90' win split is regressed toward 0.5 by
>   a **GRADED, ΔElo-dependent ko_regress (LOCKED 2026-07-04, pre-registered
>   2026-07-03)**: `k_eff = 0.70 + 0.30 × min(1, |ΔElo|/350)`. Coin-flips keep
>   the full variance buffer (k 0.70); crushing favourites barely regress
>   (k→1.00). Initial lock evidence (R32 complete, n=16): advancement Brier
>   **0.1733** vs flat-0.70's 0.1808, called 13/16; ZERO 90-minute upsets all
>   round — all 3 favourite exits were pens-after-draw (Ger +230, Ned +110,
>   Aus +92), while every ΔElo≥232 favourite advanced in 90'. Live monitoring
>   through 2026-07-07 (KO n=22): called 17/22, advancement Brier **0.1742**,
>   90' RPS **0.1576**, actual upsets 5 vs model-expected 7.00. Flat 1.00 is
>   still best on n=22 (Brier 0.1709) but remains MONITOR-ONLY, not a refit.
>   It spends the whole buffer (Argentina +495 was still dragged to 1-1 at
>   90'). Auto-graded when `--elo` is given (prints k_eff); explicit
>   `--ko-regress` overrides; falls back to flat 0.70 without Elo input. Output
>   is an **advancement probability** (`adv_home + adv_away = 1`), NOT a
>   regressed 90' W/D/L. Drop motivation/rotation — everyone is full strength.
> RULE: tune the knockout profile ONLY on its own batch (`backtest_ko.py` over
> `worldcup_2026_data_ko.py`); never mix knockout games into the group-stage
> parameter search. Discipline: any change must be pre-registered before
> testing; the n=24 (R16 complete) pre-registered review was executed
> 2026-07-08 with these outcomes:
>
> **v3.9 changes (n=24 pre-registered review, 2026-07-08):**
> - **λ floor 0.15 → 0.30 (knockout profile only) — ADOPTED.** Natural
>   experiment: Argentina 3-2 Egypt (R16). Egypt's λ was pinned at the 0.15
>   floor, making "Egypt scores 2" a ~1% event — Egypt scored 2 and led to
>   79'. Goals-channel scoring favours 0.30 across the board (P(Egy≥2) 1.1%
>   vs 3.8%, BTTS-yes logL −2.03 vs −1.42, P(3-2) 0.16% vs 0.54%); the
>   adv/RPS channels' small preference for 0.15 was survivor bias (Argentina
>   advanced anyway; cost on adv Brier ~0.005). Group profile keeps 0.15
>   (frozen). floor-0.15 remains a prospective SHADOW after the n=24 baseline;
>   only later floor-active fixtures identify a difference, with review at n=28.
> - **Ensemble weight w = 0.6 model / 0.4 market — ADOPTED** (was 50:50).
>   Unified ledger n=8: model Brier 0.1769 < market 0.1910; recomputed
>   current-Elo 50:50 ensemble 0.1834. The CSV `p_ensemble` column contains one

>   Grid-fit optimum was w=1.0, but
>   3 of 8 games are market-wrong-side low-frequency events — half-step to 0.6.
> - **graded-k HELD** (n=24: graded 0.1752 vs flat-1.00 0.1736). The paired
>   uncertainty interval crosses zero; n=28 is monitoring only and the rule is
>   frozen through the tournament.
> - **draw_boost 0.06 HELD** (neutral KO backtest口径: model 90' draws 6.8
>   expected vs 6 actual on n=24). At n=28, report the pre-registered
>   `floor {0.15,0.30} x draw_boost {0.06,0.07}` 2x2 interaction.
> - **Lineup rule codified: only adjust on OFFICIAL rulings** (confirmed
>   absences/suspensions), never on rumours or "expected out" reports;
>   re-verify suspensions match-day (Balogun overturn + Quansah lessons).
> `tournament_mc.py` reuses the SAME group profile via `elo_to_lambdas` (no

## Core math (must follow) / 核心数学原则

1. **Odds = 1 / probability.** Implied prob `p = 1/odds`.
2. **Margin / overround.** Sum the implied probs of all outcomes: `Σ(1/odds)`.
   Excess over 100% is the margin. De-margin to recover true probs:
   - Proportional: `p_i = (1/odds_i) / Σ(1/odds)`
   - Power: solve `c` so `Σ (1/odds_i)^c = 1` (shrinks favourites, lengthens
     longshots — corrects favourite-longshot bias)
   - Shin: estimates an insider-trading proportion `z`; best for outrights
   - To *offer* odds from your prob: `odds = 1 / (p × (1 + margin))`, 1X2 margin
     ~2–6% (Pinnacle low, soft books high).
3. **Poisson goals model.** Estimate `λ_home`, `λ_away` (expected goals). Score
   prob `P(k) = λ^k·e^(−λ)/k!`. Build a 0–10 score matrix → sum for 1X2,
   over/under, handicap, correct score.
4. **Dixon-Coles correction.** Poisson under-states low-score draws; apply the
   DC adjustment to 0-0/1-0/0-1/1-1 and/or nudge the draw up 1–2pts.
5. **Elo → λ.** `E = 1/(1+10^(−ΔElo/400))`. ~100 Elo ≈ 0.4–0.5 goal-difference.
   Use eloratings.net for national teams. Split expected GD into λ_home/λ_away
   around the international average (~2.6 goals/game).
6. **Market is information (the key shortcut).** Pinnacle/Betfair closing prices
   de-margined are the best public probability estimate. If your model diverges
   from the market by >3–4 points, suspect your model first.
7. **Tournaments → Monte Carlo.** Simulate the full bracket 10k–100k times;
   count champion / advancement frequencies. Knockouts: add upset variance
   (regress single-match win prob toward 0.5, ~k=0.7) or favourites get
   over-rated.

中文摘要：赔率是概率倒数；盘口有 overround，需要先去水；比分用 Poisson/Dixon-

## Two disciplines that prevent the most common mistakes / 两条关键纪律

**A. Don't double-count adjustments against the market.** Market odds ALREADY
price in home advantage, known injuries, weather and motivation. So:
- Build your Elo-derived λ *independently*, applying all the adjustments below.
- THEN compare to the de-margined market. The adjustments belong on the
  Elo-side estimate, **not** layered on top of a λ you already tuned to match
  the market — that counts the same factor twice (this is exactly how a
  "key player out" downgrade can push you 4+ points below a market that already
  knew). If your adjusted model and the market disagree by >3–4 pts, decide
  which one is missing information; don't just stack more adjustments.

**B. Check the actual conditions, never a static reputation.** A city's climate
label can be wrong on the day (e.g. a normally-mild venue during a heat spike).
Always pull the match-day, kickoff-hour forecast and the confirmed lineup
before finalising — recent reality overrides any general assumption in this
file.

中文：第一，不要把市场已经计入的信息再叠加一次；模型侧独立建模，然后和去水
盘口比较。第二，不要用城市或球队的静态印象替代比赛日现实；最终判断前要看当日
天气、开球时间、确认首发和伤停。

## Adjustments (apply to the Elo-derived λ; see Discipline A) / 调整项

- **Home advantage:** genuine home games (host nation, true home crowd) ≈
  +80–100 Elo, worth roughly +10–13 percentage points of win prob. World Cup
  neutral venues get none. Heat/fatigue partly dilutes it (less high-press).
- **Altitude:** Mexico City (~2240m) large; Guadalajara (~1566m) moderate;
  Denver/Bogotá-type high. Acclimatised side benefits; raise their λ and fade
  the visitor's stamina late.
- **Weather (verify on the day):** heat/humidity (US/Mexico summer noon games)
  saps stamina and lowers tempo → scale **total goals down ~5–10%** (mild 5% /
  moderate 8% / severe 10%) and expect more late subs/cramp; rain → slightly
  fewer goals, faster slicker pitch favouring ground play; cold/temperate or
  retractable-roof/indoor → non-factor (say so). Do not assume — check. Weather
  adjustments need auditable context: kickoff/check/forecast issue and valid
  times, HTTP(S) source, evidence type, evidence snapshot plus SHA-256,
  `weather_decision`, and `weather_scale`. Heat evidence must be checked within
  6 hours and cover the kickoff hour; forecast issue time must be within 24
  hours of the check; applied rain requires hourly/radar evidence within 3
  hours. Invalid evidence blocks current predictions.
- **xG signal (in-tournament):** a team's matchday xG beats the scoreline as a
  strength read. High xG, few goals = profligacy → nudge λ up; low xG win =
  luck → nudge λ down. Blend prior Elo with observed xG (rough Bayesian update).
- **Injuries / lineups (nuanced, not a flat number):**
  - Key attacker/playmaker out ≈ −8–15% λ, **scaled by squad depth** (a deep
    side that just scored 4 with rotation options loses less than a one-star
    team).
  - Defender/keeper out → **raise the OPPONENT's λ**, don't lower your own.
  - Confirmed strongest XI nudges toward the market; heavy rotation lowers λ.
  - First check whether the market already moved on the news (Discipline A).
- **Motivation / qualification scenarios:** a team already through or already
  eliminated rotates and drops intensity (lower λ, higher variance); a
  "must-win" or final-round six-pointer raises intensity. Dead rubbers are a
  real λ adjustment, especially matchday 3.
  - Prefer structured `competition_state` context when available:
    `mathematical_state` (`alive`, `qualified`, `eliminated`), `stake_state`
    (`normal`, `advance`, `top_spot`, `seed_only`, `dead_rubber`, `mustwin`),
    and `rotation_risk` (`low`, `medium`, `high`). This maps back to the same
    conservative motivation labels and only nudges lineup strength for rotation.
  - **⚠️ ROTATION — DON'T OVER-STACK (50-game lesson).** Apply EITHER a reduced
    Elo bump OR `--mot through` ×0.88 — **not both** (that double-discounts, the
    rotation version of Discipline A). And a strong offsetting factor can mean a
    rotated favourite still wins easily: **Mexico beat Czechia 3-0 with a rotated
    XI (Ochoa + a teenager) at 2240m** — host + altitude swamped the rotation.
    My manual call stacked +90 Elo *and* ×0.88 → pulled Mexico to 48% ("trap")
    when the un-rotated baseline said 58% and reality was a 3-0 rout. Lesson:
    rotation lowers λ modestly; don't let the narrative turn a strong favourite
    into a coin-flip, and never down-weight a host-at-altitude twice.
- **Rest & travel / fatigue:** short rest (3 days vs 4–5), long cross-timezone
  travel (US/Can/Mex venues), or extra-time in the previous round → fade λ
  modestly for the tired side.
- **Red-card / penalty tail risk (caveat, not a number):** the model prices a
  normal 11v11 game. State clearly that an early red card or early penalty
  voids the distribution and massively shifts it (we saw 3-red-card chaos and a
  7-1 blow-out at this tournament). It's a reason for the ±5% uncertainty, and
  the trigger that turns a "no big scoreline" call wrong.
- **Blowout tail / opponent game-plan (`--opp-style`, validated by backtest):**
  plain Poisson **systematically under-states big scorelines** because it treats
  goals as independent, while in reality goals pile on once the trailing side
  opens up (a 1-0 at 70' becomes 4-1). BACKTEST LESSON (10 predicted 2026 games):
  a *global* negative-binomial swap makes it WORSE (it bleeds probability off the
  many correctly-called small scores — total logL −28.3→−28.6). The fix that
  works is **selective**: fatten the favourite's right tail ONLY when the
  opponent is flagged **open/fragile pre-match** — a high line / 3-at-the-back
  pushing up, a must-chase situation, or a collapse-prone minnow. Applied that
  way it lifted backtest logL to −27.8 (+0.5), concentrated exactly on the
  under-called blowouts (Canada 6-0, Netherlands 5-1) while leaving disciplined
  low-block games (Korea, Australia, Côte d'Ivoire) untouched. Use
  `--opp-style open` for those games; keep the default (`balanced`) otherwise.
  Note it can slightly over-egg a flagged game that stays moderate, and it will
  NOT catch a blowout driven purely by hot finishing vs an organised side
  (e.g. Switzerland 4-1 Bosnia) — that's irreducible variance.

中文摘要：主场、海拔、天气、xG、伤停、首发、轮换、出线动机、疲劳和对手战术
都会影响 Elo 派生的 λ。所有调整都应保守，并先判断市场是否已经反映该信息。

## Win/Draw/Loss tipping & motivation (v3.1, backtest-driven)

Backtest over all 36 played 2026 games: an Elo+home favourite call goes **21/36
= 58%** on W/D/L — and **plain argmax NEVER picks the draw**, yet **31% of games
drew**. Two honest lessons:

- **Draw-selection rule (added):** the model now prints a `Tipset pick` that
  calls **X** for genuinely even games (no side >52% and draw ≥26%), else 1/2.
  IMPORTANT: this only catches *evenly-matched* draws (Norway-Senegal type). It
  CANNOT catch the dominant 2026 pattern — **a clear favourite held by a low
  block** (Spain 0-0 Cabo Verde, Belgium/Iran/Portugal/Ecuador all held). Those
  are the same irreducible-variance phenomenon as the under-called blowouts.
  Adding the rule did not move the historical 58% (close-game draws are rare in
  the sample) but it is correct in principle — just don't oversell draw calls.
- **Motivation (`--mot-home/--mot-away`, matchday 3):** `through` (qualified →
  rotates) and `eliminated` (downs tools) scale that side's λ ×0.88–0.90;
  `mustwin` ×1.06. Critical on the final group day — e.g. a team that has
  clinched the group and rotates is much weaker than its Elo (Mexico at Azteca
  having already qualified). Apply to the Elo λ, then compare to market (Disc A).

## Draw inflation (v3.2, 40-game backtest)

Full backtest over all 40 played 2026 games (Elo+home Poisson): W/D/L **57%**,
RPS 0.165. Two systematic gaps, both the **under-dispersion** of independent
Poisson — it puts too much mass on "favourite wins by 1-2" and too little on the
extremes:
- **Draws under-counted:** model averaged **21.9%** draw prob, actual rate was
  **32.5%** (13/40). A **+6% draw inflation** improved RPS 0.1653→0.1640.
- **Blowouts under-counted:** actual **11** net-3+ games vs model-expected
  **7.7** (same root as the `--opp-style` note).

Fix (default ON): `score_matrix(draw_boost=0.06)` / `--draw-boost 0.06` scales
the score diagonal up to add ~6 points of draw probability (set 0 for pure
Poisson). This both calibrates draw% and makes the Tipset draw rule fire on
genuinely even games. It does NOT capture favourite-held draws driven by a low
block (Spain 0-0 Cabo Verde, Uruguay 2-2 Cabo Verde) — still irreducible.

## How to get the prediction as close as possible (accuracy ceiling) / 准确率上限

Single-match football has an irreducible floor; honest expectations:
1. **Anchor on the de-margined closing market** (Pinnacle/Betfair) — it beats any
   homemade model; use the model to *understand*, lean market when they differ.
2. **Use match-day inputs, not priors:** confirmed XI, the day's weather, and
   in-tournament xG (xG > scoreline as a strength read).
3. **Model the systematic parts** that plain Poisson misses: blowout tail
   (`--opp-style`), rotation/stakes (`--mot-*`), home/altitude, injuries.
4. **Accept the irreducible parts:** draws-of-favourites and exact blowout size
   are mostly variance — express them as probabilities, never as confident
   single-score calls. Realistic W/D/L ceiling ≈ 55-60%; correct-score < ~16%
   per scoreline; ±5% per match is normal.
5. **Ensemble:** average model + market; when they diverge >3-4 pts, investigate
   the information gap rather than trusting the model.

比赛日天气、xG、动机和轮换信息；模型和市场差距超过 3-4 个百分点时，优先查
信息缺口，而不是盲目信模型。

## Workflow (every analysis) / 每次分析流程

1. **Collect (match-day, not from memory):** both teams' Elo, recent form /
   matchday xG, **confirmed** lineups & injuries, venue + **the day's** weather/
   altitude, qualification context & rest days, and current odds from ≥2 books.
2. **De-margin the market** → market-implied true probs (proportional, and
   power/Shin if precision matters).
3. **Model (independent):** Elo (+home/altitude) → λ → fold in weather, xG,
   injuries, motivation, fatigue → Poisson + Dixon-Coles → 1X2 / O-U / BTTS /
   correct score / margins.
4. **Calibrate (Discipline A):** compare the adjusted model to the de-margined
   market. If close, good. If off by >3–4 pts, name the information gap and pick
   a side — don't double-stack adjustments.
5. **Price:** prob × (1 + margin, default 5%) → "bookmaker" odds.
6. **Output (fixed format):** inputs table (Elo, xG, venue+weather, lineups,
   market de-margin) · 1X2 model vs market + fair & margin odds · O/U 2.5, BTTS,
   top 5–8 correct scores, winning-margin buckets · divergence analysis ·
   uncertainty note (±5%, red-card caveat) · disclaimer.

## Reusable scripts / 可复用脚本

Run from the skill directory (numpy needed only for the Monte Carlo;
`match_model.py` is pure-stdlib):

- `python fetch_elo_current.py --tsv <World.tsv> --fetched-at-utc <ACTUAL_TIME>
  --out elo_current_latest.py --required-team <TEAM> ...` creates a SHA-256-
  labelled current Elo module. Saved TSV input requires its actual download
  time; official paths reparse the raw TSV and fail closed on stale, missing,
  mismatched, or estimated participant ratings.
- `python predict_jul11.py finalize --fixture {norway-england,argentina-switzerland}
  --elo-module <elo.py> --elo-source-tsv <World.tsv> --context-file <context.json>
  --artifact-out <final.json>` finalizes exactly one pre-kickoff QF into a
  create-only hashed artifact using frozen w=0.6 model / 0.4 market.
- `python predict_jul11.py mc --artifacts <qf99.json> <qf100.json> --elo-module
  <elo.py> --elo-source-tsv <World.tsv> --qf98-winner {Spain,Belgium}` consumes
  the stored QF probabilities without recalculation; fresh Elo is used only for
  future SF/final simulations and live match state is not incorporated. Follow
  `AUTOMATION_RUNBOOK.md` for the two isolated finalization windows.
- `python scripts/match_model.py --lh 1.95 --la 0.85 --odds 1.53 4.25 6.70`
  Pass λ directly, *or* `--elo 1891 1775 [--home 85]` to derive λ. Adjustment
  flags (applied after λ is set, with a printout of what changed):
  - `--heat {mild,moderate,severe}` scale total goals 0.95/0.92/0.90
  - `--rain` slick/low-scoring scale ~0.95
  - `--inj-home M` / `--inj-away M` multiply that team's λ (e.g. 0.90 = key
    player out; use the *opponent's* flag >1.0 or this side <1.0 as fits)
  - `--opp-style open` fattens the favourite's blowout tail (negbin) for a
    high-line / must-chase / fragile opponent; `--dispersion r` tunes it
    (default 5, lower = fatter). Default `balanced` = plain Poisson. Set from a
    PRE-MATCH read, not the result (see Blowout-tail note above).
  - `--mot-home / --mot-away {normal,through,eliminated,mustwin}` matchday-3
    motivation (qualified rotates / eliminated downs tools / must-win lifts).
  - `--stage {group,knockout}` selects the parameter profile (default `group`).
    `--stage knockout` lowers `avg_goals` to 2.70 and prints an **advancement**
    block (90'→ET→penalties); tune via `--ko-regress` / `--pen-tilt`. Explicit
    `--avg-goals` / `--gd-per-100` / `--draw-boost` still override the profile.
  Prints de-margined market, 1X2 + **Tipset pick (with draw rule)**, O/U, BTTS,
  top scorelines, fair + margin odds, total-goals / winning-margin distributions.
- `python scripts/tournament_mc.py [--sims N] [--damp 0.72]` — Monte Carlo over
  a 12-group + knockout config (edit embedded Elo or pass `--json`). Reuses the
  group stage profile via `elo_to_lambdas` (one source of truth). NOTE: the
  embedded ratings are a snapshot — refresh from eloratings.net before reuse, and
  the bracket is a random PRE-DRAW estimate — supply the fixed R32 bracket once
  the group stage is complete for an accurate from-here forecast.
- `python backtest_ko.py` (repo root) — knockout-only backtest over
  `worldcup_2026_data_ko.py`, kept SEPARATE from the 72 group-stage games.
- `python predict_r32.py` (repo root) — advancement-to-R16 table for the 16
  fixed Round-of-32 ties. Exact (needs only the matchups, no bracket tree).
- `python predict_bracket.py [--sims N]` (repo root) — Monte Carlo over the
  fixed R32 bracket for R16/QF/SF/Final/Champion odds. `R32_FIXTURES` is in the
  official FIFA bracket-tree order (Match 73-104), so the pairings are exact.

## Market-context pipeline / 市场上下文管线

Use this when the user wants to prepare, enrich, validate, or merge market
context data before it reaches the model.

中文：当用户需要准备、补全、验证或合并市场上下文数据时使用该管线。它只处理
数据输入，不改变核心模型默认值。

Quick start from the skill directory:

```bash
python3 create_context_template.py --source jun25 --format csv --output /tmp/jun25.csv
python3 fetch_the_odds_api.py --fixture-csv /tmp/jun25.csv --fixture-json odds_payload.json --output-csv /tmp/jun25.odds.csv
python3 run_context_pipeline.py --fixture-source jun25 --market-source odds-api --odds-api-fixture-json odds_payload.json

python3 create_context_template.py --source jun26 --format csv --output /tmp/jun26.csv
python3 run_context_pipeline.py --fixture-source jun26 --market-source odds-api --odds-api-fixture-json odds_payload.json --prediction-slate jun26
```

Use the recorded `--fixture-json` path for deterministic/offline replay. Use
live Odds API only when the user explicitly provides `--api-key`/`--sport-key`
or has set `ODDS_API_KEY` and `ODDS_API_SPORT_KEY`.

June-26 result update path:
- Keep predictions in `JUNE_26_MATCHES`; enter confirmed final scores only in
  `JUNE_26_RESULTS`.
- `MATCHES_66` is `MATCHES_60 + JUNE_26_RESULTS`, so it remains a 60-game
  baseline until the six final scores are verified.
- Run `python3 backtest_66.py` after filling the results. If results are still
  missing, the script reports the 60-game baseline and explicitly skips the
  batch-5 out-of-sample section.

中文：6 月 26 日预测赛程保留在 `JUNE_26_MATCHES`；确认后的最终比分只填入
`JUNE_26_RESULTS`。在 6 场结果全部确认前，`MATCHES_66` 仍等同 60 场基线。

1. `python create_context_template.py --source jun25 --format csv` to generate a
   fillable template with `home`, `away`, `market_odds`, `market_confidence`,
   optional `competition_state`, and notes fields.
   Use `--source jun26` for the June 26 slate.
2. `python fetch_the_odds_api.py --fixture-csv <template.csv> --fixture-json
   <recorded_payload.json> --output-csv <enriched.csv>` to replay a saved Odds
   API response. For live requests, pass `--api-key` and `--sport-key` or set
   `ODDS_API_KEY` and `ODDS_API_SPORT_KEY`.
3. `python import_context_csv.py --input <enriched.csv> --output
   <context.json>` to merge into the shared JSON schema without overwriting
   missing fields.
4. `python validate_context.py --context-file <context.json>` to check coverage,
   overround, confidence, competition-state rows, and model-market gaps.
5. `python run_context_pipeline.py --fixture-source jun25 --market-source
   odds-api --odds-api-fixture-json <recorded_payload.json>` to run the whole
   flow in one command. Use `--prediction-slate jun26` for the June 26 slate.

Keep the ingestion path optional. The model should still work when the user
only has a hand-built CSV or a recorded fixture JSON.

CSV format note: keep `competition_state` as one JSON text column for
compatibility. Example:
`{"home":{"mathematical_state":"qualified","stake_state":"advance","rotation_risk":"medium"},"away":{"mathematical_state":"eliminated","stake_state":"dead_rubber","rotation_risk":"high"}}`.
Weather provenance is mandatory for current predictions, including no-adjustment
outdoor decisions. Historical replay may load legacy rows, but any asserted
weather override must still pass `validate_weather_context`.
